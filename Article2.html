            The fire started at about 2:30 a.m. on Saturday, July 19, 1845, on the third floor of J. L. Van Doren, Oil Merchant and Stearin Candle Manufacturer, 
        known as a seller of whale oil, at 34 New Street in Manhattan, and spread quickly to adjoining buildings. The City Hall alarm bell began to ring at about 3:00 a.m., 
        summoning firefighters.

            During the ten and a half hours that it burned, the fire had destroyed buildings from Broad Street below Wall Street to Stone Street, 
        up Whitehall Street to Bowling Green, and up Broadway to Exchange Place. Thirty people in total were killed—including four firefighters 
        and 26 civilians—and buildings were reported destroyed on Broadway, New Street, Broad Street, Exchange Place, Beaver Street, Marketfield Street, 
        Whitehall Street, and South William Street. All told, the fire destroyed 345 buildings in the southern part of what is now the Financial District, 
        resulting in property damage estimated at the time between $5 million and $10 million

        The Great New York City Fire of 1845 was the last of three particularly devastating fires that affected the heart of Manhattan, the other two occurring in 1776 and 1835. 
        While very destructive, the 1845 fire confirmed the value of building codes restricting wood-frame construction. 
        In 1815, city officials had banned new construction of wood-frame structures in the densest areas of the city. 
        The 1845 fire demonstrated the efficacy of these restrictions, 
        as the progress of the fire was checked when it spread toward areas rebuilt after the 1835 fire with such materials as stone, masonry, and iron roofs and shutters. 
        In spite of general improvements, the 1845 fire prompted public calls for a more proactive stance in fire prevention and firefighting.

    To strengthen the city's firefighting capabilities, the city established a reserve unit called the Exempt Fireman's Company, 
    so called because it was made up of firemen who were exempt from militia and jury duty. 
    The company was led by veteran fireman Zophar Mills, who had helped stop the 1835 fire from crossing Wall Street.
